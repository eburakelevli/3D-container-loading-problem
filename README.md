# 3D-container-loading-problem
The company that we have worked with was struggling to load the items to the container. <br />
This items are in different size, shape and weight. <br />
We have developed exact and heuristic methods to solve this problem.<br />
These methods than have been coded in JAVA by me. <br />
Then I have generated random instances to test my code to see how the code behaves in different instances.
These instances are in different size, shape, weight and different number of items.
